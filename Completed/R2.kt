/*
Problem Set from https://open.kattis.com/
The number S is called the mean of two numbers R1 and R2 if S is equal to (R1 + R2)/2 . Mirkoâ€™s birthday present for Slavko was two integers
R1 and R2. Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost R2! Help Slavko restore R2 .

Input
The first and only line of input contains two integers R1 and S1, both between -1000 and 1000 .
Output R2 on a single line.
