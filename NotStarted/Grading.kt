Per works at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and thus grades a lot of exams each day.

The grading process is rather simple. First, you define five grading limits a, b, c, d and e.
At least a% of the exam score is required to get an A grade, at least b% is required for a B, and so on, and e% is
required to get an E. If you get less than e% you get an F.
Per’s management has recently complained about a lot of mistakes that Per made during grading, so they want
you to construct a program to help Per grade exams.

Input
The first line of the input contains the five integers a, b, c, d and e (100>=a>=b>=c>=d>=e>=0 ).
The second line contains a single integer – the exam score in percent of an exam Per is currently grading.

Output a single letter A-F – the grade of the exam Per is currently grading.
